Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard -

Banks need to make informed decisions when approving or rejecting loan applications. Without proper data analysis, it becomes difficult to identify the patterns and risks associated with applicants. This project aims to solve the following problems:

What factors are most associated with loan approval or rejection?

How does credit history impact loan approval rates?

What is the distribution of loans among different demographic groups?

How do applicant and co-applicant incomes affect the loan amount?

Which customer segments pose higher risk based on historical data?

This dashboard enables the bank’s management team to monitor key metrics, identify trends, and support data-driven decision-making.
